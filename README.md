From his description:
"Itâ€™s a Kotlin portation of the Clipper project developed by Angus Johnson, which as an implementation of the algorithm proposed by Bala R. Vatti. ... This port based on C# Clipper version 6.4.2."

Original Angus Johnson project's documentation:

We just made the port kotlin multiplatform compatible, by removing all platform-specific methods.
